# Facial emotion recognition using deep neural networks
<br>
This work is focussed on predicting the emotions using images. The research utilizes the KDEF dataset, consisting of 4900 images across 7 emotion classes.
<br>
This framework uses fusion network of VGG-19 and DenseNet-121. The features from these two networks are concatenated and fed to the dense network for final classification.
